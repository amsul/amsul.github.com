Hello fellow, human! So nice of you to drop by :)

I'm Amsul (https://twitter.com/amsul_)

I generated this static site using jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com)
I used Sublime Text to code everything (https://sublimetext.com)
And Mou for touching up my markdown posts (https://mouapp.com)
I also hosted and open sourced this site on Github (https://github.com/amsul/amsul.github.com)

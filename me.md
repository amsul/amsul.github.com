I&rsquo;m a developer-slash-designer living in [Toronto, Canada](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&sugexp=les;&gs_rn=1&gs_ri=hp&cp=10&gs_id=11&xhr=t&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bvm=bv.41642243,d.aWc&biw=1440&bih=802&q=toronto+ontario&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x89d4cb90d7c63ba5:0x323555502ab4c477,Toronto,+ON,+Canada&sa=X&ei=HLwJUY7pDYKVygHCr4HIDw&sqi=2&ved=0CLYBELYD) and I <small>&hearts;</small> the open web. I&rsquo;ve built [some](https://github.com/amsul?tab=repositories 'Github: My open source projects') [stuff](http://foursixty.com/ 'Foursixty: A freelance project') [before](http://m.buytopia.ca/ 'm.buytopia.ca: Cannot stress this enough… JUST the mobile site experience'). Some of it turned out to be [quite useful](http://amsul.github.com/pickadate.js 'pickadate.js') - while some other stuff I [couldn&rsquo;t bother finishing](http://amsul.github.com/Load.allTheThings/). Then there's the other stuff I did [just because](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/ 'CoffeeScript Cookbook: Design and layout') [I was bored](https://github.com/amsul/Slideshow 'Bored enough to make another slider').

Now, as far as I can see, I&rsquo;m going to continue building more stuff. So if you want to chat more about the [stuff I&rsquo;ve built](https://github.com/amsul?tab=repositories), the stuff <a href="javascript:alert('ಠ_ಠ\n\nNot sure I can trust you enough to reveal that just yet.')">I&rsquo;m currently building</a>, the stuff [I would like to build some day](http://www.badstartupidea.com/), or just wanna say &ldquo;hi&rdquo;, you can [tweet](https://twitter.com/amsul_) or [email](mailto:reach@amsul.ca) me. I&rsquo;d love to talk more about this stuff.

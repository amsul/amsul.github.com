title: Of course there is a page fold. Nobody lands scrolling

The fold doesn&rsquo;t exist in the [traditional sense](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/design-theory/designing-for-the-new-fold-web-design-post-monitorism/) where there is only one defined &ldquo;fold&rdquo;. But the essence is definitely very real; in that we, as designers, need to create the experiences that invite our visitors to scroll.

Understand who is visiting and why. Then design an experience that makes them believe: there is no fold.

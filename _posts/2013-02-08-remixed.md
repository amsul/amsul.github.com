title: Remixed
---


I decided to finally rid myself of the behemoth that is WordPress in exchange for [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as my blogging solution.

There are quite a few reasons that made me want to make the switch. But the gist of it all is that jekyll

- is very lightweight and easy to setup,
- ditches databases for a file-based system,
- generates static pages but can still use many awesome tools typically used with dynamic sites,
- most importantly, [integrates beautifully with Github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages).

When I was done making the move, I realized that pretty much 90% of the stuff on this site (and many other recent ones I worked on) is ~~shamelessly stolen~~ [remixed](http://www.ted.com/talks/kirby_ferguson_embrace_the_remix.html) from open source code.

The 10% &ldquo;not-so-open-source&rdquo; or original code would generally be the [template](https://github.com/amsul/amsul.github.com/tree/master/_layouts), [design](https://github.com/amsul/amsul.github.com/tree/master/css), [content](https://github.com/amsul/amsul.github.com/tree/master/_posts), and back-end algorithms (if that).

And although this is not really a &ldquo;for profit&rdquo; site, the ones that *are* also utilize front and back-end packages that are openly available.

From the basics of the [bullet proof font-face syntax](http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/) (learnt from [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish)), to the intricacies of a [mobile-first mentality](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/the-many-faces-of-mobile-first/) (inherited from [Brad Frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost) and [Luke Wroblewski](https://twitter.com/lukew)) and the [wizardry](http://csswizardry.com) of complex websites with [big CSS](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/big-css) (stolen from [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) and inuit.css<sup>[1](#postscript_1)</sup>).

My point is, the open source community is [built around love](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3421-clay-shirky-on-why-love-makes-open-source-communities-work) and helps us all. It&rsquo;s educational, it&rsquo;s foundational, and quite often even inspirational. That&rsquo;s why I believe software should generally be free<sup>[2](#postscript_2)</sup>.

It&rsquo;s not the code that makes businesses profitable, it&rsquo;s their product. If it&rsquo;s useful, people will pay - even if 90% of it is freely available scattered across the web.
